## Usage

Install repository dependencies:

```sh
yarn
```

To solve a new problem, add a directory to `./src/days`, for example `./src/days/01` for day one.

Add two files to the folder:

 1. `inputs.txt` with your inputs from the website
 2. `index.ts` with a copy from `./template.ts`

Implement your solution. To run it, type:

```sh
yarn compile
yarn solve 01
```
